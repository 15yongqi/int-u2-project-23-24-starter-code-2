  <p> Mei Xiang and Tian Tian arrived in the United States in 2000. The two newly arrived giant pandas were first leased
    to the United States for ten years according to a formal agreement. The two parties later signed two extension
    agreements, each for five years, and the last one was five years. The one-year extension ended at the beginning of
    the COVID-19 outbreak. The Chinese partners of the agreement agreed to an extension for another three years, and the
    family returned to China in November this year.</p><a href="https://www.pandasinternational.org"> Here is a link to
